The essential story I wanted to portray in the site is for it to be a space by foodie’s alike, regardless of skill level, are able to come together on a site to share knowledge and information. 
The structure of the website leans towards one of an online magazine.

Inspiration:

https://www.epicureasia.com/
A food Blog where they share everything to do with food and lifestyle. I was inspired by this webiste through their use of the gallery where when it is clicked on will bring the user to a new article. 

https://sgmagazine.com/food-and-drink
I was inspired by their navigation bar which utilised the hover effect when the user's cursor was pointed over. Furthermore, I liked that they have utilised imaghes which can be clicked on. 


https://vogue.sg/ 
Inspired me through the use of a specific colour, red. It was used on the website as a hover effect when the cursor is over images and articles. 
It inspired me to use the main colour theme in a website in a way that would not be too jarring to the user.


Accessibility:

For the visually impaired, I have opted for blue as the overall theme through all the webpages of the site as upon reading up on visual impairment, red and green is difficult to distinguish.
Secondly, in today’s climate, we spend the majority of our time in front of a screen and that might cause strain in our eyes and fatigue. 
Therefore, users are able to switch from light mode to dark mode with the click of an icon on the navigation bar.
Thirdly, for all images I have added alternate comments to ensure that regardless of one’s visual impairment, they are able to understand the story I would like to bring across with the use of images



Usability: 

I considered the usability of the website mainly based on what I would like to see as a user. 
As a user myself, I found it over stimulating if there were too many images and text boxes and preferred websites that had a more straight-forward approach.


Secondly, while deciding on what I wanted the colour palette of the website to be, I researched on how different colours affect the branding of your site as well as how the visually impaired perceive colours.

Thirdly, throughout the course of ideating and prototyping and eventually coding the site, I kept going back to the Google Chrome console to better understand how the site might look across different screen sizes.
In order to, better design the site to increase the ease of use for the user.


Learning:

The implementation of a dark and light theme mode. I wanted to include this as a component of the website, as it allows users to customize their experience of how they view the site. 
However, in order to do so, I had to implement a var function in my CSS which will enable the colours to change when the icon is clicked on.
The hover effect on images to showcase the visual element of the page while giving explanation and context for the user.


Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?


I believe that I was able to successfully bring across the theme of the food website through the use of simplistic design which is easy to understand and focused on having specific information of certain pages.
I was able to have call to action blocks in each page which will enable users to click onto the another page which might interest them and have increased the accessibility of moving to another page through the implementation of a button in the call to action block.
Secondly, I believe having links to the other pages through the use of a call to action block as well as a footer will enable a user to visit the page more. 


Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?

I would have liked for the toggle to dark or light mode to be saved regardless of which page the user was on. However, I was unable to figure out which part of the Javascript I could link to ensure that the user's progress was saved. 
Secondly, I would have liked to have a customer service bot and more articles in each page so that it can better put across the purpose of the page. I believe that a customer service bot would have been able to engage with a user while they were browsing the site. 

Resources: What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of information, libraries, plugins, code, or tools (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using comments)
code, or

I used https://fontawesome.com/ tor all the icons on the page and the recipes are from https://www.epicurious.com/
I used unsplash.com for images across the site. Furthermore, I heavily utilised W3schools for CSS references.
